# Nursing Homes

Nursing homes are facilities for people who do not need to be in hospitals, but cannot be cared for at home.  Every year an inspection is done at each nursing home and given an overall rating from one through five.  The overall rating is based on three aspects of the nursing home:

1. Health Inspections - This rating is based on the three most recent annual health inspection investigations as well as recent inspections due to complaints. These inspections are conducted by a state employee to determine whether the nursing home has met the state's minimum quality requirements. Any deficiencies are weighted by scope and severity, and also takes into account the number of revisits required to make sure the deficiency has been corrected. 

2. Staffing - This rating has information regarding the number of hours provided on average to each resident each day. This is based on two measures: RN hours per resident and total nurse hours per resident (this is the sum of RNs, LPN, and nurse aides). 

3. Quality Measures - This rating is based on how well nursing homes are caring for their residents' physical and clinical needs. It includes a total of 17 measures based on performance (10 measures for long-term stays and 7 measures for short-term stays). Some of these measures include percentage of hospitalizations or falls, new or worsened bed sores, depression, etc.



I believe that the Quality Measures are the most important part of the overall rating. It not only measures how well the residents are being treated in the home, but it also helps new consumers decide where to place a loved one, gives current consumers more info on the environment where loved ones already are, and gives facilities information to improve quality efforts.


My goal for this dataset is to test how health inspections and staffing affect the quality of care.



The dataset was taken from data.medicare.gov and was last updated August 1, 2019. It covers 15,512 nursing homes throughout the US with 85 different features.
