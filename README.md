# Nursing Home Ratings




## Introduction


As our loved ones grow older, it becomes more and more difficult for them to remain in their home by themselves. Not only are they are more prone to injuries and risks of under/over medicating, but activities of daily living such as bathing and eating become increasingly more difficult. While family and friends are able to take care of them at the beginning, many reach a point where 24 hr care is needed and they can no longer stay in their home.

Nursing homes are a great alternative when loved ones reach this point. They are facilities for people who do not need to be in hospitals, but cannot be cared for at home and offer the most extensive care a person can get outside a hospital. Most facilities have both long term and short term residents, and include services such as:
    - Acitivies of Daily living such as bathing, dressing, and eating
    - Skilled care such monitoring medications, physical therapy, occupational therapy, etc.
    - 24 hour emergency care
    - Social activities

#### How do you choose the best nursing home for your loved one? 

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services have developed a rating system to help with this decision. Every year an inspection is done at each nursing home throughout the US and given an overall rating from one through five. This was designed to help consumers, families, and caregivers compare nursing homes.


## Data Overview


The overall rating is based on three aspects of the nursing home:

1. Health Inspections - This rating is based on the three most recent annual health inspection investigations as well as recent inspections due to complaints. These inspections are conducted by a state employee to determine whether the nursing home has met the state's minimum quality requirements. Any deficiencies are weighted by scope and severity, and also takes into account the number of revisits required to make sure the deficiency has been corrected. 

2. Staffing - This rating has information regarding the number of hours provided on average to each resident each day. This is based on two measures: RN hours per resident and total nurse hours per resident (the sum of RNs, LPN, and nurse aides). 

3. Quality Measures - This rating is based on how well nursing homes are caring for their residents' physical and clinical needs. It includes a total of 17 measures based on performance (10 measures for long-term stays and 7 measures for short-term stays). These measures include percentage of hospitalizations or falls, new or worsened bed sores, depression, etc.

This dataset was taken from data.medicare.gov and was last updated August 1, 2019. It covers 15,512 nursing homes throughout the US with 85 different features. We are going to focus on the three aspects that make up the overall rating.

## Hypothesis Testing

I believe that the Quality Measures are the most important part of the overall rating. It not only measures how well the residents are being treated in the home, but it also helps new consumers decide where to place a loved one, gives current consumers more info on the environment where loved ones already are, and gives facilities information to improve quality efforts. My goal for this dataset is to compare if the state mandated health inspections have any effect on the quality of care.
